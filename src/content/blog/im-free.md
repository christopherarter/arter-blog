I’ve finally left Twitter / X and currently hanging out on BlueSky: [https://bsky.app/profile/arter.dev](https://bsky.app/profile/arter.dev)

I won’t get into why I left X, and if you’re not sure what the problem is with X then it’s where you belong anyway.

Tl;dr I felt chained to it because of my career, as it’s the defacto hang out for folks in the Laravel / web space. But BlueSky has hit critical mass, in my opinion, and there are tons of familiar faces there.

All of the same friendly folks without the neo facism <3
