In this article, Iâ€™m going to show you a simplified setup of how Iâ€™ve used Spatie [Roles & Permissions](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-permission/v6/introduction) package with [Laravel Sanctum.](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/sanctum) This will allow users Sanctum tokens to respect the userâ€™s abilities through this package.

Why?
----

Roles and permissions is a widely used package for determining authorization within your application. I treat a userâ€™s abilities through its role as the source of truth for what this user can or cannot do.

By default, sanctum allows for `*` ability, which means this token has cart blanche across any middleware checks.

You can also pass explicit permissions to the token:

```php
$user->createAccessToken('some-token', ['view:protected-rotue'])->plainTextToken
```

The abilities of a token are _specific to that given token_, so regardless of the user the token belongs to, the token can do anything in its capabilities column.

This introduces scenarios where we may not give a user the permission to do an action, but in creating a token for this user, they may be able to perform those actions through their API token.

In effect, weâ€™d be maintaining **_two authorization systems._** Life is too short to work that hard.

ðŸ’¡

By default, abilities are stored in the `abilities` column in the `personal access tokens` table.

How to sync with Spatie Permissions
-----------------------------------

Basically, weâ€™re going to override how Laravelâ€™s default `PersonalAccessToken` class looks up a tokenâ€™s capabilities and defer to its `tokenable` modelâ€™s capabilities. The `tokenable` model is our `User` model by default.

### Install Roles & Permissions + Sanctum

To begin, you should have both Spatie Roles & Permissions installed, as well as Laravel Sanctum.

During installation, make sure you:

*   Apply the `HasRoles` and `HasApiTokens` traits to the User model.
    
*   Publish the configurations and run all applicable migrations.
    
*   If your user model is using UUIDs, then be sure to [configure your migrations.](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-permission/v6/advanced-usage/uuid)
    

### Extend the Personal Access Token

The Sanctum docs detail how to override the Personal Access Token model [here.](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/sanctum#overriding-default-models)

Following the same pattern, create a new file in `/app/Models/CustomToken.php` This is the new model Sanctum will use to manage tokens.

```php
<?php

    namespace App\Models;
    
    use Laravel\Sanctum\PersonalAccessToken as SanctumPersonalAccessToken;
    
    class CustomToken extends SanctumPersonalAccessToken
    {
        public $table = 'personal_access_tokens';
    
        public function can($ability)
        {
            return $this->tokenable->can($ability);
        }
    }
```

This class is overriding the `can()` method. Originally, the method does a look up on the tokenâ€™s abilities column. Our class will proxy the same ability check, but against our user modelâ€™s permissions according to the Spatie permissions package.

### Register the Custom Access Token Model

Next, we need to tell Sanctum to override the default model for our Custom token.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Providers;

use App\Models\CustomToken;
use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;
use Laravel\Sanctum\Sanctum;
    
    class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
    {
        public function register(): void
        {
            //
        }
    
        public function boot(): void
        {
            Sanctum::usePersonalAccessTokenModel(CustomToken::class);
        }
    }
```

Example Usage
-------------

Here is a basic setup for seeing the same rule set in action across web guard and sanctum.

### Routes

Our `web.php` routes file could look like this:

```php
Route::get('/protected', function () {
    Route::get('/protected', function () {
        return 'This is protected';
    })->middleware('auth', 'can:view-protected');
```

And your `api.php` route looks like this:

```php
Route::get('/protected', function () {
    return 'This is protected by sanctum';
})->middleware(['auth:sanctum', 'can:view-protected'])
        ->name('api.protected');
```

If you do not have a `/routes/api.php` file yet, first create a `/routes/api.php` file. Then, in your `bootstrap/app.php` file, you can add it here:

```php
->withRouting(
    web: __DIR__.'/../routes/web.php',
    commands: __DIR__.'/../routes/console.php',
    api: __DIR__.'/../routes/api.php', // ðŸ‘ˆ Add this
    health: '/up',
)
```

### Tests

Next, we can try out our new setup using some tests below.

```php
<?php

use App\Models\User;
use Spatie\Permission\Models\Permission;
use Spatie\Permission\Models\Role;

use function Pest\Laravel\get;
    
    beforeEach(function () {
        $this->role = Role::create(['name' => 'admin']);
        $this->permission = Permission::create(['name' => 'view-protected']);
        $this->role->givePermissionTo($this->permission);
        $this->route = route('api.protected');
    });
    
    test('user can access protected route', function () {
        $user = User::factory()
            ->create()
            ->assignRole($this->role);
    
        $this->actingAs($user)
            ->get('/protected')
            ->assertStatus(200);
    });
    
    test('user cannot access protected route', function () {
        $user = User::factory()->create();
        $this->actingAs($user)
            ->get('/protected')
            ->assertStatus(403);
    });
    
    test('Spatie permissions are proxied to token abilities', function () {
    
        $token = User::factory()
            ->create()
            ->givePermissionTo('view-protected')
            ->createToken('test-token')
            ->plainTextToken;
    
        get(route('api.protected'), ['Authorization' => 'Bearer '.$token])
            ->assertOk(200);
    });
```

In the tests above, weâ€™re verifying that a user can access the same respective abilities in both the API as well as the web guard (our web app).

Trade-offs & Advanced Usage
---------------------------

In a tradition as old as time, when figuring out if this pattern makes sense for your application, the answer is always _it depends._ I find this approach works brilliantly if I have a both a user-facing dashboard, as well as a public API, and I want to create a simple token that allows users to do exactly what they can do in the admin. However, there are trade offs. In our simpler approach, we donâ€™t account for allowing users to create more granular-permission tokens, which violates the [Principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege#:~:text=If%20execution%20picks%20up%20after,in%20defence%20and%20intelligence%20agencies.).

If a user wants to be more granular with token scopes, we can alter our approach to allow a layered permission check. In the class below, this would allow the `User` to create either tokens with specific permissions, or defer to the inherited permissions of the user.

```php
<?php

    namespace App\Models;
    
    use Laravel\Sanctum\PersonalAccessToken as SanctumPersonalAccessToken;
    
    class CustomToken extends SanctumPersonalAccessToken
    {
        public $table = 'personal_access_tokens';
    
        public function can($ability)
        {
            // if the user can't do it, our token can't either.
            if(!$this->tokenable->can($ability)) {
                return false;
            }
    
            // no wildcards. sorry Charlie.
            $abilities = collect($this->abilities)->filter(function($ability) {
                return $ability !== '*';
            })->toArray();
    
            // we have explicit permissions passed to `createAccessToken`
            if(count($abilities) > 0) {
                return $this->canDb($abilities);
            }
    
            return true;
    
        }
    
        protected function canDb($ability): bool
        {
            return array_key_exists($ability, array_flip($this->abilities));
        }
}
```
