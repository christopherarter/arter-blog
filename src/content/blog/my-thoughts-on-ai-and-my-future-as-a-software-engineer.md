Just want to get a few things out of the way:

\- **These are just my opinions, man.**

\- The sky is not falling

\- AI is (probably) coming

\- Devin is vaporware

I’m doing some reflection looking for the most level-headed plan that both acknowledges and respects AI could displace a very large number of developers (myself included), but I’m also not advocating for panicking.

### Let's acknowledge that AI is coming

AI will improve in quality rapidly as it already has, so I think taking any kind of solace in its shortcomings now is just copium, as if this train will suddenly stop. I don’t think it will. I think it's reasonable to see the forest for the trees and acknowledge that AI is coming in some form or another.

### AI doesn't need to be perfect to replace (most of) us.

Even if the AI is only 80% as good, my gut sense is that is all the incentive a huge number of non-FAANG employers will need to drastically reduce the engineering team headcount. Most small / medium sized businesses that are not tech companies but employ engineers will see the largest reduction.

Notice I didn’t say replace. Reduce. And that’s the takeaway I think will blindside a lot of tech workers.

Will it replace us all? I don’t think so. But what is left behind will be a skeleton crew whose main job is to monitor AI systems like the sysadmin in Silicon Valley.

Overall, I think it will cause a significant contraction in the market for the commodity of development (because that is what it is).

Is there anything we can do? I’m not sure. I can’t predict the future and I don’t want to suffer over a future that may never come. But, I also want to focus on what is within my control to mitigate the risk if it does, to a reasonable degree. Again, don’t let the doomers ruin your vibe.

Just my opinions as I parse some existential dread over a glass of wine and an elasticsearch error in my console.

Oh, and Fuck Devin.
