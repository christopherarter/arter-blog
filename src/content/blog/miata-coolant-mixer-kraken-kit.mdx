When doing a loose fitment test just to make sure everything generally fit together,
I noticed that the coolant mixer housing was interfering with the turbo.

Photo of the issue:

  />
</div>

But, thanks to Car Guy Friday's video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQahLGNxEk&t=14s), 
they showed how they modified the housing to clear the turbo. It's as simple as cutting off the 90 degree
elbow (no welding).

Be sure to use a sanding disc or something to smooth out the edges so it doesn't 
slice the coolant tube.

Best of luck!
