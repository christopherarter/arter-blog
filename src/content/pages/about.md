My name is Chris Arter, and I'm a self-taught Software Engineer originally from sunny Florida. 🌴

## Origin Story

During the recession (early 2010), I lived between my car and a friend's garage. I had no job, and plenty of time on my hands. I taught myself to code over stolen wi-fi on YouTube. That decision would ultimately change my life forever. A decade later, I earn a comfortable living and provide for my family. You can read my entire story on [NoCsDegree](https://www.nocsdegree.com/why-learn-php-chris/).

Since then I've worked in start-ups, agencies, lead gen firms as well as aerospace companies. I've created brands that have made Inc 500s Fastest Growing Companies in America (twice), contributed to the Laravel PHP framework, and have shipped amazing products.

I now live in North Carolina, USA with my wife and two kids.

Outside of tech:
- I'm a huge Jags fan (DUUUUVAL)
- I'm deeply involved in Miata community and own too many of them.
- I'm a life long gamer, and have been a fan of the Diablo series from the start.
- I enjoy spending time with my family & playing with my kids, welding in the garage, and scouring junkyards for parts.
