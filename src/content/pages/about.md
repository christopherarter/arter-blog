My name is Chris Arter, and I'm a self-taught Software Engineer originallyfrom sunny Florida. ðŸŒ´

Origin Story
During the recession (early 2010), I lived between my car and a friend's garage. I had no job, and plenty of time on my hands. I taught myself to code over stolen wi-fi on YouTube. That decision would ultimately change my life forever. A decade later, I earn a comfortable living and provide for my family. You can listen to my entire story on [NoCsDegree](https://www.nocsdegree.com/why-learn-php-chris/).

Since then I've worked in start-ups, agencies, lead gen firms as well as aerospace companies. I've created brands that have made Inc 500s Fastest Growing Companies in America (twice), contributed to the Laravel PHP framework, and have shipped amazing products.

I now live in North Carolina, USA with my wife and two kids.
