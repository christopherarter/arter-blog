HourlyRate.fyi is a practical calculator that helps freelancers and independent contractors determine their required hourly rate based on their desired take-home income. 

Users input their target monthly income after taxes and insurance, along with their expected work schedule (weeks per year and hours per week), tax rate, and monthly health insurance costs. The tool then calculates the gross hourly rate they need to charge clients to achieve their desired net income. 

This approach takes the guesswork out of pricing by accounting for often-overlooked factors like taxes, insurance, and time off, helping professionals set rates that actually meet their financial goals.
